    <p> My name is Jose Casillas. I am 34 years old married and have a daughter. I am currently studying to be a web
        developer.
        I currently have taken some classes online at freecodecamp, codecademy and the odin project.
        I am looking forward to learning as much as I can and receiving any feedback so that I can improve my coding
        skills.
    </p>

    My favorite website currently is <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freecodecamp</a> because it is helping
    me learn coding.
