        <p> My name is Jose Casillas. I am 34 years old married and have a daughter. I am currently studying to be a web
            developer.
            I currently have taken some classes online at freecodecamp, codecademy and the odin project.
            I am looking forward to learning as much as I can and receiving any feedback so that I can improve my coding
            skills.
        </p>
